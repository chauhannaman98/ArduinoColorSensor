 *  
 * This sketch reads a HC-SR04 ultrasonic rangefinder and returns the
 * distance to the closest object in range. To do this, it sends a pulse
 * to the sensor to initiate a reading, then listens for a pulse 
 * to return.  The length of the returning pulse is proportional to 
 * the distance of the object from the sensor.
 *   
 * The circuit:
 * * VCC connection of the sensor attached to +5V
 * * GND connection of the sensor attached to ground
 * * TRIG connection of the sensor attached to digital pin 
 * * ECHO connection of the sensor attached to digital pin
